# Movie Recommendation
In this project, we have the movie ratings of aroung 90 classmates, and we will recommend for each group member the movie they may like the most.

We use collaborative filtering, considering both item-based similarity and user-based similarity. Here, we use cosine similarity as similarity measurement.

Please refer to 'movie rating.xlsx' as the rating data.
