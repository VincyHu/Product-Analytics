# Movie Recommendation
In this project, the movie ratings of 90+ classmates are collected, and we will recommend for each group member the movie they may like the most.

I used collaborative filtering, considering both item-based similarity and user-based similarity. Here, cosine similarity is used as similarity measurement.

Please refer to 'movie rating.xlsx' as the rating data.
